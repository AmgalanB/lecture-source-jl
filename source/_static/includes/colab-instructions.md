## Colab Instructions

1. Load the notebook using the launcher at the bottom of the page, and ignore any errors about a missing kernel. 

2. Run the cell below this one in the notebook. It might take 3 to 5 minutes. 

3. In the top menu, click "Edit," then "Notebook Settings," and then choose "Julia 1.4" as your runtime. Hit "Save."

4. To test your setup, run a Julia command in the window (something like `versioninfo()`.) If it doesn't work, try refreshing your browser window in between steps (2) and (3).
